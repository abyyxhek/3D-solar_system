3D Solar System using Three.js

This project is a 3D simulation of the Solar System created using Three.js. Each planet orbits the Sun with adjustable speeds controlled via UI sliders. This assignment demonstrates real-time rendering, animation, and user interaction with vanilla JavaScript and Three.js.

ðŸš€ Features

3D rendering of the Sun and all 8 planets

Realistic orbiting animation

Real-time speed control sliders

Responsive layout

Built with pure HTML, JS, and Three.js (no build tools required)

ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

solar-system-threejs/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ README.md

ðŸ›  How to Run the Project

**Install **Visual Studio Code if you haven't already.

Install the Live Server extension from VS Code Extensions.

Open the solar-system-threejs folder in VS Code.

Right-click index.html and choose "Open with Live Server".

The project will open in your browser and start animating.

ðŸ’¡ Adjust each planet's speed using the control sliders on the page.

ðŸ“¹ Demo Video Instructions

Record a 2â€“3 minute video that:

Shows the solar system animation

Demonstrates real-time speed control

Explains how planets and orbits are created

Walks through the code and folder structure
